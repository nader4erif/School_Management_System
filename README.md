# School_Management_System
Project to control the system of the school.
Welcome to the School Management System project! This C-based project aims to provide a user-friendly system to manage student data efficiently using linked lists. The system allows you to add new students, delete existing ones, edit student information, update scores, rank students by Computer Science scores, and display the student list alphabetically.

Table of Contents Introduction Project Goals Features Installation Usage Contributing Introduction This project is developed as part of level one C and Embedded C course at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI). The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in C programming, data structures, and algorithms by creating a functional School Management System.

Project Goals The main objectives of this project are:

Implementing a linked list to store and manage student data efficiently. Designing a custom data structure to hold relevant information about each student. Demonstrating proficiency in fundamental C programming concepts. Applying sorting algorithms to rank students based on their Computer Science scores. Developing a user-friendly menu system for easy interaction with the School Management System. Features The School Management System comes with the following features:

Add Student: Allows users to add a new student with their details, such as name, address, ID, birth date, phone number, and Computer Science score.

Delete Student: Enables users to remove a student from the list based on their ID.

Edit Student Data: Allows users to modify a student's information, including name, address, and Computer Science score.

Update Scores: Provides functionality to update the Computer Science scores of all students in the list.

Rank Students: Ranks the students in descending order based on their Computer Science scores, using the bubble sort algorithm.

Display Student List Alphabetically: Displays the list of students in alphabetical order of names.
